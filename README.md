# Tree

A tree is a collection of nodes and edges (connections/lines)

## Characteristics

- Each tree's start node is called the `root node`
- Each node has only one parent node
- Edges in a tree are s called `branches`
- Nodes at the end with no children are called `leaves`
- The longest path from a leaf to the root is `height`

## Usecases

- File storage
- Comment trees
- Calculating the order of operations
- The Document Object Model (DOM)
- Data compression

Like a tree, only without the strict rules on Left or Right only

## Characteristics

- Trie is short for `Retrieval` 
- Each trie has a root node
- Each node has a value
